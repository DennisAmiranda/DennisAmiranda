## Hello there ðŸŒ±
I'm a Computer Science student and I'm in love with learning, I tackle hard problems, especially theoretical and fundamental ones ones. 
I mainly code in Python and C/C++ but I'm versatile, as I also know some Javascript, PHP, SQL and Minizinc.

## Current research interests ðŸ”­
My current interests lie in the fields of both theoretical and applied Machine Learning, Cybersecurity and Cryptography and Computational Mathematics.
