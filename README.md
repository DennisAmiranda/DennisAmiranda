## Hello there ðŸŒ±
I'm a Computer Science student and I'm in love with learning, I tackle hard problems (especially theoretical ones) and changing the world. 
I mainly code in Python and C/C++ but I'm versatile, as I know also some Javascript, PHP, SQL and Minizinc.
I like understanding Mathematics, ML/DL, Cryptography and Theoretical Computer Science.

## Current research interests ðŸ”­
My current interests lie in the fields of both theoretical and applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
